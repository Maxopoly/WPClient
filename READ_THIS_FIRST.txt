2. General:

To get access to the WPClients source code, contact Maxopoly.

You can do so by sending a reddit PM to /u/Maxopoly or a discord PM to Maxopoly#3569

Be aware that any client side mod can steal your minecraft login cookie and give access to your account to a third party.
This is especially important here, as maliciously modified versions of this software would have a very easy time stealing
your login cookie, without there being a noticeable difference in the provided jar. Due to that I'd recommend using only
jars directly provided to you by Maxopoly.

3. Installation

This mod is currently using Minecraft version 1.10.2. Assume everything from here on is supposed to be compiled against 1.10.2

You will need a minecraft installation with Minecraft Forge. You can get Forge here: https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.10.2.html

The WPClient itself is a ForgeMod, which requires JourneyMap and JEI (JustEnoughItems) to work.

You can get JourneyMap here: https://mods.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/journeymap/2435300
A version of it should have also been provided to you along with the WPClient jar

JustEnoughItems needs to use a special custom version, which should have been provided to you as well. Using any other version of it than that one will not work.

All three of those .jar files need to be put into your mods/1.10.2 folder in your minecraft installation after installing Forge.

Simply start up Minecraft with your Forge profile after adding the jars, if you get through to Minecraft's main menu, everything worked. If not, complain to Maxopoly.

4. Usage

4.1 Chest stock keeper:
Every time you close a chest with this mod, it's content and location will be sent to the server. Consider this when dealing with chests that you dont want others to find.
To lookup an item's location you can open up your inventory and left click an item in JEI's GUI. You can show/hide this GUI by pressing CTRL+O, which can also be rebound under 'Controls'.
Waypoints indicating the desired items location will automatically be created.

4.2 Locator:
Waypoints will be automatically created at the location of any known player. A player is known if he is using this mod, is in radar range of someone using this mod or has hit a snitch,
for which someone using this client got a notification. Due to that you can turn player rendering off in JM, it's replace with waypoints. A recommended set of JM setting should have also been 
provided to you along with the binaries. Simply merge the journeymap folder into your minecraft folder to import the recommended settings.
